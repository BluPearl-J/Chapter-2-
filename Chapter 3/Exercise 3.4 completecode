#(Fill the Code) In the code below 
#for ***:
# for ***:
# print('@')
# print()
#replace the *** so that when you execute the code, it displays two rows, each containing
#seven @ symbols, as in:
#@@@@@@@
@@@@@@



To display two rows, of seven @ symbols each, nested loops:

The outer loop  runs 2 times (for the two rows)

The inner loop  runs 7 times (to print seven  symbols per row)

for i in range(2):
    for j in range(7):
        print('@', end='')
    print()
range(2) â†’ runs the outer loop twice (for two rows)
